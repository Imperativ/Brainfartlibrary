Create a Confluence form using ConfiForms that generates a Jira Epic with four sub-tasks. Use only ConfiForms' graphical elements (no code/storage format editors).

Requirements:

    Form Fields: 
	Epic name, Epic description, Priority (dropdown), Assignee (user picker), Due date (date field), 
	Issue type (dropdown), Jira project (dropdown), optional Jira key (text field)
    
	Issue Checkboxes: Four checkboxes ("Create Issue 1–4") – sub-tasks are only created if the corresponding checkbox is selected
    
	Checklist Templates:
        Epic page: Template-based checklist (e.g., "Standard Epic Checklist")
        Each issue: Unique checklist (issue-specific templates like "Test Checklist" or "Documentation Checklist")
    
	Jira Integration:
        Use "ConfiForms IFTTT Integration Rules" for Jira creation (trigger: form submission)
        Generate Jira keys and provide feedback in Confluence
   
   Output: Tabular confirmation with Jira key, name, creator, and status
   
   
Clarifications Needed:
    Checklist Templates: Where are the templates stored? (Confluence pages, global snippets?)
    Jira Field Mapping: Which Jira fields should be mapped to which ConfiForms fields?
    Template Engine: Should ConfiForms' "Create Page" function be used for checklists?

Solution Approach (using ConfiForms graphical elements only):
    Form Setup with "Confiforms Field Definition" for all input fields
    IFTTT Rules per checkbox (four rules, each linked to Jira issue creation + template integration)
    Confirmation Report via "Confiforms Report Macro" with filters for newly created entries

To Verify:
    Are Jira APIs for Epic/Issue creation enabled in the target system?
    Does the Confluence user have write permissions for the Jira project?
