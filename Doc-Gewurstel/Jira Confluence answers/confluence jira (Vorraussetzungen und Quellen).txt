confluence jira (Vorraussetzungen und Quellen)
wenn der User fragen zu Jira, Confluence, Confiforms oder altlassian stellt. 


Enhanced Prompt:
Given prerequisites:
I use Confluence 8.5 and Jira 9.12, both in Server/Data Center deployments, connected via network integration.
Only use elements that are available to me through the normal Confluence page editor,
or that are provided to me by the confiforms plugin (which is a mandatory requirement for development), 
such as "Confiforms Field Definition", "Confiforms IFTTT Integration Rules" and all the other graphical elements.

I lack admin rights and cannot access Storage Format Editor or other technical editors. 
With a little effort and a few days' time, I can commission my colleague, who is a Confluence and Jira admin,
to do things that would require admin rights. 

Goal: Create a functional prototype. If possible, do this in the first pass, by getting the best possible result from Manus. 
If not, continue with further passes until the user achieves a result they are satisfied with.with Manus.

Before you begin the task, review the task, analyze initial search results, and let me know if you need more information.
Before you begin the actual work, wait for the user's final decision. 
Or ask yourself if you can get started now if you think you have everything you need.

Required workflow:
    Pre-task analysis:
        Verify task requirements against Atlassian's official documentation (Confluence/Jira integration guides)
        Review Confiforms resources:
            Documentation at wiki.vertuna.com
            Tutorials/Cookbook at confiforms.com
            Atlassian Community forums (https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Products/ct-p/products)
        Scan social media for relevant content (YouTube transcripts, forum discussions)
    Confirmation phase:
        Report missing information requirements
        Await final user approval before implementation
    Development constraints:
        No backend access or custom code
        Strict adherence to Confiforms' GUI components
        Network-dependent Jira/Confluence interaction

Before proceeding with the actual prototype development, confirm whether you require additional details about:
    Specific Confiforms components available in my instance
    Exact Jira-Confluence integration features enabled
    Prototype's functional scope (data types/validation requirements)

Await explicit authorization to begin development after all verifications.
